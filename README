So this is the basic setup for the beginning of the SDL Engine

A 2D platformer

For simplistic means I have made
the player or character you control
a simple white box.

Starting the app drops the white box in from above.

Arrow keys left and right move respectivly.
Up jumps.
The p key toggles from full screen and back to windowed.

If you click with the mouse it will
drop a random colored long rectangle platform box.
They will stack and you can jump around and up onto
the platforms for fun.

Enjoy!
